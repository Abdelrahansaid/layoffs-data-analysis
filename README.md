## 🔍 Key Analysis Highlights

### 1. Data Cleaning Essentials
```sql
-- Standardize crypto industry names
UPDATE layoffs
SET industry = 'Crypto'
WHERE industry LIKE 'Crypto%';

-- Temporal validation
SELECT 
    MIN(date) AS first_record,
    MAX(date) AS last_record,
    COUNT(*) AS null_dates
FROM layoffs;
```

### 2. Critical Insights
```sql
-- Worst layoff year
SELECT 
    YEAR(date) AS layoff_year,
    SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_employees,
    COUNT(DISTINCT company) AS affected_companies
FROM layoffs
GROUP BY layoff_year
ORDER BY total_employees DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Top 3 impacted industries
SELECT 
    industry,
    SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_layoffs,
    ROUND(SUM(total_laid_off)*100/(SELECT SUM(total_laid_off) FROM layoffs),1) AS pct_total
FROM layoffs
GROUP BY industry
ORDER BY total_layoffs DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
